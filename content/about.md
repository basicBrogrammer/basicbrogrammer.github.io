# About Me

What up ðŸ¤™

I'm Jeremy and I love long walks on the beach .... JK! But I do love the beach.

I graduated from UNC in 2013 with a degree in physics. I was expecting to launch my career in engineering, however, I didn't have the accreditations needed for most entry-level electrical engineering positions. I took a job installing solar panels on residential rooftops in the triangle area while taking classes to get an Electrical Engineering Degree. A friend told me about The Iron Yard (TIY), a 12-week Coding Bootcamp,  and I thought that would be the best launching pad for my career. During the Bootcamp, I would code for 60-80 hours per week, but it was well worth it. I came out of the other end with a great job and have been there ever since.

I've always worked on side projects to learn more about web development. Right after TIY, I was playing league of legends and decided to create lolmeet.net to help players meet up IRL. This was fun and a blogger in Poland actually helped grow the user base to +1200. I pivoted from this into consultant work. After working on 4-5 consultant gigs, I realized I would much rather spend my time outside of my full-time gig working on personal projects. As of late, I've come back to passion projects with MTB Group Rides.

Side projects allow me to play with new tech and new ideas. The first iteration of MBGR was built with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) + [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) + [Stimulus.js](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/). With this stack, I was able to create a PWA using a [conference talk by John Beatty](https://speakerdeck.com/johnbeatty/yes-rails-does-support-pwas). John Beatty talked about not blocking the main thread which gave me the idea to use Stimulus, [ActionCable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) and [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) to asynchronously load pages with background workers. Currently, I'm rewriting it with [Hasura](hasura.io) + [Ionic](ionic.io) + [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) + [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).
